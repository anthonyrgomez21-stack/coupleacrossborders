Nie było to poszukiwanie stałości ani pewności — tylko ciekawość, humor i chwila otwartości wysłana w świat. A jednak, w sposób, który tylko Bóg mógł zaplanować, to pytanie dotarło dalej, niż kiedykolwiek mogłem sobie wyobrazić."

Her energy didn’t just come through the screen — it reached me. There was warmth in her tone, confidence in her curiosity, and a gentleness that felt rare. I didn’t analyze it. I didn’t hesitate. I simply knew I wanted to meet her."
data-pl="Julia była pierwszą osobą, która do mnie napisała. Nie publicznie, nie dla uwagi — prywatnie. Cicho. Z intencją. Już od pierwszych słów coś wydawało się inne. Jej energia nie tylko przebijała się przez ekran — ona do mnie docierała. W jej tonie było ciepło, w ciekawości pewność siebie, a w delikatności coś rzadkiego. Nie analizowałem tego. Nie wahałem się. Po prostu wiedziałem, że chcę ją poznać."

What neither of us knew was that this “first date” would quietly stretch into three days — three days that would redefine everything I thought I knew about love."
data-pl="Wsiadłem więc w poranny pociąg do Krakowa. Zarezerwowałem Airbnb, żeby być blisko, bez pośpiechu, w pełni obecny. Powtarzałem sobie, że to tylko randka — okazja, by poznać kogoś interesującego. Ale gdzieś głęboko czułem, że to coś więcej, jakbym wchodził w historię, która już została napisana. Nie wiedzieliśmy wtedy, że ta „pierwsza randka” cicho rozciągnie się na trzy dni — trzy dni, które zmienią wszystko, co myślałem o miłości."

Somewhere between walking the city, sharing meals, and getting lost in each other’s presence, the word <em>perfect</em> stopped making sense. This wasn’t perfection — it was recognition. The kind that doesn’t announce itself loudly, but settles deep in your chest and stays there."
data-pl="Czas niemal natychmiast przestał istnieć. Rozmowy płynęły, jakby czekały na nas od lat. Śmiech przychodził naturalnie. Cisza była bezpieczna. Gdzieś pomiędzy spacerami po mieście, wspólnymi posiłkami i zanurzeniem się w swojej obecności, słowo <em>idealne</em> przestało mieć znaczenie. To nie była perfekcja — to było rozpoznanie. Ciche, głębokie, osiadające w sercu i zostające tam na zawsze."

data-pl="Burza przyszła nagle, gwałtowna i bezkompromisowa, zalewając miasto, gdy staliśmy w pobliżu Wawelu. Niedaleko cicho stał krzyż Jezusa Chrystusa, jakby czuwając nad tą chwilą. Pamiętam, jak spojrzałem na Julię — deszcz spływał po jej włosach, świat wokół był rozmyty — i poczułem, że ta chwila jest święta. Poprosiłem ją o rękę. Bez wahania mi ją podała. Powiedziałem jej, żeby biegła."

Like a scene written by someone who believed deeply in love. A fairytale — not imagined, but lived."
data-pl="Biegliśmy przez deszcz, trzymając się za ręce, z bijącymi sercami, aż ciemność pękła w jednym punkcie światła — starej latarni ulicznej świecącej w nocy. Obróciłem ją ku sobie. Deszcz lał się z nieba. Czas się zatrzymał. Tam, pod tym światłem, mokrzy, śmiejący się i całkowicie bezbronni, pocałowaliśmy się. To było nierealne. Jak scena napisana przez kogoś, kto naprawdę wierzy w miłość. Baśń — nie wyobrażona, ale przeżyta."

Noc rozwijała się w cichych krokach i skradzionych chwilach — spacerując ręka w rękę, przytulając się, całując się, jakbyśmy bali się, że świat nas obudzi. Została ze mną tej nocy. Następnego dnia ja zostałem u niej. A dzień później pojechała ze mną do Wadowic. Wciąż wybieraliśmy jeszcze jedną chwilę, jeszcze jedną godzinę, jeszcze jedno wspomnienie."
